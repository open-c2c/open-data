## Conventions

All conventions have a general quality and expectation to be accepted in this repository, given other systems, sites and tools that many people use rely on. Submitting a convention in this repository means that you wish those external sites to consume it, and make this submission available in their systems.

The philosophy behind this is to help everyone discover conventions to attend, and furries, being very resourceful, build tools, sites and cool reports to aid in this quest. So everyone must stand behind this philosophy and add or edit information that will keep everyone's life easier.
